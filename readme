## Topic?
After a lot of thinking we realized that it would be great to work with something known by most of us, and the answer was clear: __BEER__.
Luckily, we _do_ know a public API about this topic, called [PUNK API](https://punkapi.com). The website has the necessary documentation to work with it.
## App needs
Using the data from the provided API, we need the Web app to:
* Display a list of 10 beers with their {
name:
date:
image:
description:
}
* Implement a delete button to delete the beer on your list
* BONUS Add a search bar to search for a beer based on it's title
